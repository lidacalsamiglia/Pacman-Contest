Initially we wanted to implement an approximate Q-learning agent. Due to time constraints and the fact that we were not getting satisfying results we decided to go to the brute-force path. Our idea is the following: manage to get the offensive agent to go to the opposing team's maze and eat one food (if possible), then return to our maze and randomly go vertically, defending our field. We are aware the code is not the most elegant but we had fun doing so in the rush we were.
